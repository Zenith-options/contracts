# Governance Handbook

Zenith's admin powers (fees, listings, oracle config, pausing, upgrades) are
ultimately controlled by ZEN holders through the **governor** and executed by
the **timelock**. This handbook covers how that works and how to use it. The
path from today's single admin to this end state is in
[governance-handover.md](governance-handover.md).

## Contracts

| Contract   | Role |
|------------|------|
| `governor` | Proposals, voting, quorum. Queues passed proposals into the timelock. |
| `timelock` | Admin of every protocol contract. Delays each call by `min_delay`; anyone may execute a ready operation. |
| ZEN token  | Checkpointed voting token exposing `get_past_votes(account, ledger)` and `get_past_total_supply(ledger)`. The governor calls it through the `Votes` interface in `governor/src/interfaces.rs`. |

## Proposal lifecycle

```
propose ──► Pending ──(voting_delay)──► Active ──(voting_period)──► Defeated
                │                          │                        Succeeded ──queue──► Queued ──timelock.execute──► Executed
                └──────── cancel ──────────┴────────────────────────────┴───────────────────┘        └─(grace elapsed)─► Expired
                                         ▼
                                      Canceled
```

1. **Propose** — `propose(proposer, targets, fns, args, description_hash)`.
   The proposer needs at least `proposal_threshold` votes as of the previous
   ledger. The id is `sha256(xdr(targets, fns, args, description_hash))`
   (`hash_proposal` computes it off-chain too); an identical proposal cannot
   be submitted twice. At most `MAX_ACTIONS` (10) calls per proposal.
2. **Pending** until the snapshot ledger `propose_ledger + voting_delay`.
3. **Active** for `voting_period` ledgers after the snapshot. Vote with
   `cast_vote(voter, id, support)` where `support` is `0` Against, `1` For,
   `2` Abstain. Weight is the voter's power **at the snapshot ledger**.
   - `cast_vote_by_sig(voter, id, support)` is the gasless variant: the voter
     signs a Soroban authorization entry for exactly `(id, support)` and any
     relayer submits it. The host checks the signature and a nonce, so it
     can't be replayed.
4. **Succeeded / Defeated** — succeeded iff `for + abstain ≥ quorum` **and**
   `for > against`. A tie is a defeat. Quorum is
   `quorum_bps × past_total_supply(snapshot) / 10 000`.
5. **Queue** — anyone calls `queue(id)`; the governor schedules the batch in
   the timelock under the same id with the timelock's `min_delay`.
6. **Execute** — after the delay, anyone calls `timelock.execute(id)`. The
   governor reports **Executed** once the timelock marks it done, or
   **Expired** if `grace_period` passes first.

### Cancelling

- The proposer may cancel while the proposal is **Pending**.
- **Anyone** may cancel a Pending/Active/Succeeded/Queued proposal if the
  proposer's current voting power has dropped below `proposal_threshold`.
  Cancelling a queued proposal also removes it from the timelock.
- Until lock-in, the timelock **guardian** can cancel any queued operation.

## Parameters

Changed only by a passed proposal targeting the governor itself (the call
arrives from the timelock). Ledgers assume ~5 s.

| Parameter            | Setter                    | Bounds |
|----------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| `voting_delay`       | `set_voting_delay`        | 0 – 241 920 ledgers (~2 weeks) |
| `voting_period`      | `set_voting_period`       | 720 (~1 h) – 241 920 ledgers |
| `quorum_bps`         | `set_quorum_bps`          | 100 (1%) – 10 000 (100%) |
| `proposal_threshold` | `set_proposal_threshold`  | ≥ 0 |

Timelock settings are changed by a proposal whose target is the timelock
itself with `set_delay(u64)`, `set_prop(Address)` or `lock_in()`.

## Attack resistance

| Attack | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Flash-loan / last-minute votes | Power is read at the snapshot ledger, which is already in the past when voting opens. |
| Double voting | One vote per address per proposal (`has_voted`). Moving tokens after the snapshot does not create new power. |
| Proposal spam | `proposal_threshold`, and anyone can cancel a proposal whose proposer has sold below it. |
| Quorum manipulation | Quorum uses total supply at the snapshot, not at vote time. |
| Malicious proposal passes | `min_delay` gives users time to exit; before lock-in the guardian can cancel. |

## Why the timelock executes, not the governor

Soroban forbids a contract from being re-entered. If the governor called the
timelock and the timelock called back into the governor (for example, to change
`quorum_bps`), the call would fail. The timelock's `execute` is therefore
open to anyone, and the governor never sits in the execution call stack.
