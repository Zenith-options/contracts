//! Cross-contract client for vault, same pattern and same reason as
//! multisig_client.rs and price_oracle_client.rs: contractimport! against
//! vault's compiled wasm, not a normal source dependency, to avoid linking
//! vault's own #[contractimpl] functions into options_market's wasm and
//! colliding on shared names (pause/transfer_admin again).
//!
//! Requires vault's wasm in the shared workspace target/ before this crate
//! can compile at all; `cargo xtask build` handles that (see
//! `[package.metadata.zenith] wasm-deps` in ../Cargo.toml).
