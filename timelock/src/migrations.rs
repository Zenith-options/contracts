//! Storage-schema migration steps for this contract. The framework
//! (version checks, ordering, pagination, the in-progress guard) lives in
//! `zenith_common::migrations`; this file only registers steps. See
//! docs/migrations.md for how to author one.
//!
//! The timelock administers itself: there is no `migrate` entrypoint.
//! Instead `execute` dispatches a `Call` targeting the timelock with
//! function `migrate` and args `(from: u32, to: u32)` to `self_migrate`
//! below, the same way it handles `set_prop` / `set_delay` / `lock_in`.
//! A migration is therefore always a delayed, cancellable operation. It
//! must be its own operation, after the one that installs the new wasm:
//! a wasm swap only takes effect once the invocation that made it
//! returns, so a `migrate` self-call in the same `execute` would still run
//! the old code.
//!
//! NOTE: this crate's lib.rs, error.rs, events.rs, types.rs and
//! Cargo.toml are empty on main (emptied by #148). Once they're restored:
//! add `zenith-common = { path = "../common" }` to Cargo.toml,
//! `mod migrations;` to lib.rs, the migration error variants (codes
//! 100–104) to `Error`, `init_schema` to `initialize`, and in `self_call`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! } else if *func == symbol_short!("migrate") {
//!     migrations::self_migrate(env, arg(env, args, 0), arg(env, args, 1));
//! }
//! ```
