//! Versioned storage-schema migrations, shared by every Zenith contract.
//!
//! Each contract stores a `SchemaVersion(u32)` in instance storage and
//! compiles in a `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` plus a step registry (its own
//! `migrations.rs`). A step is keyed by the version it migrates **to**:
//! step `n` turns a layout-`n-1` contract into a layout-`n` one. Steps are
//! code in the new wasm, so upgrading is always `upgrade(new_wasm_hash)`
//! followed by `migrate(old, new)` — see docs/migrations.md.
//!
//! Guarantees enforced here, once, for every contract:
//! - `migrate(from, to)` only runs when the stored version equals `from`,
//!   so a completed step can never be repeated (the stored version has
//!   moved past it).
//! - Steps run strictly in order `from+1 ..= to`, each recording its own
//!   version bump, so no step can be skipped.
//! - `to` may not exceed the running wasm's `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`.
//! - A step that is too large for one transaction reports `More(cursor)`;
//!   the migration is then *in progress* and must be finished with
//!   `migrate_batch(cursor, limit)`, which only accepts the exact cursor
//!   the previous batch stopped at (no replayed or skipped pages).
//! - `require_schema_current` blocks normal entrypoints while a migration
//!   is in progress **or** while the stored version lags the code (the
//!   wasm was upgraded but `migrate` hasn't run), so a half-migrated
//!   contract never serves traffic.
//!
//! Authorization is the caller's job: each contract checks its own admin /
//! multisig / timelock before `migrate`. `migrate_batch` is meant to be
//! exposed permissionlessly: it can only advance a migration an
//! authorized `migrate` already started.
